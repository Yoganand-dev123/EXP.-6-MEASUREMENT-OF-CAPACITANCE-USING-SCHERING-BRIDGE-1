# MEASUREMENT OF CAPACITANCE USING SCHERING BRIDGE

## AIM

To Determine the Capacitance of an unknown Capacitor using Schering Bridge.

## Procedure:

Apply Supply voltage (3V) from the signal generator with arbitrary   frequency.

Set the unknown Capacitance value from 'Set Capacitor Value' tab by clicking on 'Set' button.

Then switch on the supply to get millivoltmeter deflection.

Choose the values of   C2, C4, R3 and R4 from the capacitance and   resistance box. Varry the values to some particular values to achieve   "Null".

Observe the millivoltmeter pointer to achieve "Null" or closest to  "Null".

If "Null" is achieved, switch to 'Measure Capacitor value' tab and   click on 'Simulate'. Observe calculated values of unknown   Capacitor (C1) and it's Internal Resistance (r1). Also observe the   Dissipation factor of the unknwown capacitor which is defined as   ω * C * r .    Where, ω = 2 π f.

N.B.:-
Range of C2 and C4 = 100`pF` to 11.111`uF` (in steps of 100`pF`).
Range of R3 and R4= `1  Ω` to `11111110  Ω`  (in steps of 1 `Ω`)

Set Capacitor Value :

Measure Capacitor Value: 

The current voltmeter reading is: 

   Capacitor value (in uF):

   Resistance value (in Ω): 

   Dissipation Factor:
